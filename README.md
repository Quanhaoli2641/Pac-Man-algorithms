# Pac-Man-algorithms
*Algorithms to play Pac-man*

Included in this package is the entire Pac-man framework along with the algorithms.

The actual algorithms are linked [here](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/tree/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman).

The following algorithms were implemented for this algorithm: 
  * [Depth first Search](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/DFS.java)
  * [Breadth first Search](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/BFS.java)
  * [Itterative Deepening](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/ItterativeDeepening.java)
  * [Astar](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/Astar.java)
  * [Hill Climber](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/HillClimbing.java)
  * [Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/SimulatedAnnealing.java)
  * [Evolutionary with CrossOver](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/Evolution.java) 
  * [Evolutionary with Mutation](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/Pac-Man-algorithms/blob/master/src/pacman/entries/pacman/Evolution2.java)
